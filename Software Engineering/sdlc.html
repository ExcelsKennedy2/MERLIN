    <section>
      <p>Software Development Life Cycle, SDLC for short, is a well-defined, structured sequence of stages 
        software engineering to develop the intended software product.</p>

        <h3>SDLC Activities</h3>
        <p>SDLC provides a series of steps to be followed to design and develop a software product efficient
          SDLC framework includes the following steps:</p>

        <h4>Communication</h4>
        <p>This is the first step where the user initiates the request for a desired software product. He contacts the
          service provider and tries to negotiate the terms. He submits his request to the service providing
          organization in writing.</p>

        <h4>Requirement Gathering</h4>
        <p>This step onwards the software development team works to carry on the project. The team holds
          discussions with various stakeholders from problem domain and tries to bring out as much information
          as possible on their requirements. The requirements are contemplated and segregated into the user: 
          <ul class="card">
            <li>studying the existing or obsolete system and software,</li>
            <li>conducting interviews of users and developers,</li>
            <li>referring to the database or</li>
            <li>collecting answers from the questionnaires.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

        <h4>Feasibility Study</h4>
        <p>After requirement gathering, the team comes up with a rough plan of software process. At this step the
          team analyzes if a software can be made to fulfill all requirements of the user and if there is any
          possibility of software being no more useful. It is found out, if the project is financially, practically and
          technologically feasible for the organization to take up. There are many algorithms available, which help
          the developers to conclude the feasibility of a software project.
          </p>

        <h4>System Analysis</h4>
        <p>At this step the developers decide a roadmap of their plan and try to bring up the best software model
          suitable for the project. System analysis includes Understanding of software product limitations,
          learning system related problems or changes to be done in existing systems beforehand, identifying
          and addressing the impact of project on organization and personnel etc. The project team analyzes the
          scope of the project and plans the schedule and resources accordingly.</p>

        <h4>Software Design</h4>
        <p>Next step is to bring down whole knowledge of requirements and analysis on the desk and design the
          software product. The inputs from users and information gathered in requirement gathering phase are
          the inputs of this step. The output of this step comes in the form of two designs; logical design and
          physical design. Engineers produce meta-data and data dictionaries, logical diagrams, data-flow
          diagrams and in some cases pseudo codes.
          </p>

        <h4>Coding</h4>
        <p>This step is also known as programming phase. The implementation of software design starts in terms
        of writing program code in the suitable programming language and developing error-free executable
        programs efficiently.</p>

        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <p>An estimate says that 50% of whole software development process should be tested. Errors may ruin
          the software from critical level to its own removal. Software testing is done while coding by the
          developers and thorough testing is conducted by testing experts at various levels of code.</p>

        <h4>Integration</h4>
        <p>Software may need to be integrated with the libraries, databases and other program(s). This stage of
          SDLC is involved in the integration of software with outer world entities.</p>

        <h4>Implementation</h4>
        <p>This means installing the software on user machines. At times, software needs post-installation
          configurations at user end. Software is tested for portability and adaptability and integration related
          issues are solved during implementation.</p>

        <h4>Operation and Maintenance</h4>
        <p>This phase confirms the software operation in terms of more efficiency and less errors. If required, the
          users are trained on, or aided with the documentation on how to operate the software and how to keep
          the software operational. The software is maintained timely by updating the code according to the
          changes taking place in user end environment or technology. This phase may face challenges from
          hidden bugs and real-world unidentified problem
          </p>

        <h4>Disposition</h4>
        <p>As time elapses, the software may decline on the performance front. It may go completely obsolete or
          may need intense upgradation. Hence a pressing need to eliminate a major portion of the system
          arises. This phase includes archiving data and required software components, closing down the
          system, planning disposition activity and terminating system at appropriate end-of-system time.</p>
          
        <h3>Software Development Paradigm</h3>
        <p>The software development paradigm helps developer to select a strategy to develop the software. A
          software development paradigm has its own set of tools, methods and procedures, which are
          expressed clearly and defines software development life cycle. A few of software development 
          paradigms or process models are defined as follows:</p>

        <h4>Waterfall Model</h4>
        <p>Waterfall model is the simplest model of software development paradigm. It says the all the phases of
          SDLC will function one after another in linear manner. That is, when the first phase is finished then only 
          the second phase will start and so on.</p>
        <img src="images/waterfall-model.png" alt="sdlc-waterfall-model" class="img-p img-fluid">
        <p>This model assumes that everything is carried out and taken place perfectly as planned in the previous
          stage and there is no need to think about the past issues that may arise in the next phase. This model
          does not work smoothly if there are some issues left at the previous step. The sequential nature of
          model does not allow us go back and undo or redo our actions.</p>
        <p>This model is best suited when developers already have designed and developed similar software in the
          past and are aware of all its domains.</p>
        
        <h4>Iterative Model</h4>
        <p>This model leads the software development process in iterations. It projects the process of
          development in cyclic manner repeating every step after every cycle of SDLC process.</p>
        <img src="images/iterative-model.png" alt="sdlc-iterative-model" class="img-p img-fluid">
        <p>The software is first developed on very small scale and all the steps are followed which are taken in
          consideration. Then, on every next iteration, more features and modules are designed, coded, tested and
          added to the software. Every cycle produces a software, which is complete in itself and has more
          features and capabilities than that of the previous one.
          </p>

        <h4>Spiral Model</h4>
        <p>Spiral model is a combination of both, iterative model and one of the SDLC model. It can be seen as if
          you choose one SDLC model and combine it with cyclic process (iterative model).</p>
        <img src="images/spiral-model.png" alt="sdlc-spiral-model" class="img-p img-fluid">
        <p>This model considers risk, which often goes un-noticed by most other models. The model starts with
          determining objectives and constraints of the software at the start of one iteration. Next phase is of
          prototyping the software. This includes risk analysis. Then one standard SDLC model is used to build
          the software. In the fourth phase of the plan of next iteration is prepared.
          </p>

        <h4>V-Model</h4>
        <p>The major drawback of waterfall model is we move to the next stage only when the previous one is
          finished and there was no chance to go back if something is found wrong in later stages. V-Model 
          provides means of testing of software at each stage in reverse manner.</p>
        <img src="images/v-model.png" alt="sdlc-v-model" class="img-p img-fluid">
        <p>At every stage, test plans and test cases are created to verify and validate the product according to the
          requirement of that stage. For example, in requirement gathering stage the test team prepares all the
          test cases in correspondence to the requirements. Later, when the product is developed and is ready for
          testing, test cases of this stage verify the software against its validity towards requirements at this
          stage.</p>
        <p>This makes both verification and validation go in parallel. This model is also known as verification and 
          validation model.</p>

        <h4>Big Bang Model</h4>
        <p>This model is the simplest model in its form. It requires little planning, lots of programming and lots of
          funds. This model is conceptualized around the big bang of universe. As scientists say that after big
          bang lots of galaxies, planets and stars evolved just as an event. Likewise, if we put together lots of
          programming and funds, you may achieve the best software product.</p>
        <img src="images/big-bang-model.png" alt="sdlc-big-bang-model" class="img-p img-fluid">
        <p>This model is not suitable for large software projects but good one for learning and experimenting.</p>
